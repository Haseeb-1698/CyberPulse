You are a senior cybersecurity analyst AI. Based on the detailed CVE metadata below, analyze the vulnerability holistically. Provide a comprehensive JSON response with these fields:

1. "title": A concise, one-line title under 100 characters. Clearly identify the affected system or component and the core risk.

2. "summary": Provide a 2–3 sentence paragraph that:
   - Explains the nature of the vulnerability and affected components
   - Describes the real-world security risk based on CVSS, exploit data, and impact
   - Highlights if this vulnerability is commonly used in known attack chains or by specific threat actors

3. "exploit_risk_assessment": Based on exploit count, maturity, and actor usage:
   - Rate the risk as "Low", "Medium", or "High"
   - Provide reasoning behind your rating (e.g. "Active PoC in Metasploit and used by MuddyWater")

4. "remediation_steps": Provide 3–5 **tailored** technical actions to mitigate the vulnerability. Prefer:
   - Specific configuration or patching guidance
   - If patch not available, compensating controls or behavioral detections
   - Map to relevant MITRE ATT&CK mitigations if possible

5. "strategic_recommendation": A 2–3 sentence expert note for a security manager or SOC lead. Answer:
   - Should this be prioritized urgently? Why?
   - What systems or teams are likely affected?
   - Are there lateral movement or privilege escalation concerns?

6. "related_tactics_techniques": Return a list of MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques based on the mapped data. Each entry must include:
   - "id": Technique ID
   - "name": Friendly name
   - "tactic": Mapped ATT&CK tactic (e.g., "Initial Access", "Execution")
   - "relevance": Float value between 0 and 1 (how relevant this technique is to the CVE)

7. "threat_actor_insight": If known threat actors are linked:
   - Summarize the behavior or typical campaigns of the top 1–2 groups
   - Mention if this CVE aligns with their known TTPs or infrastructure
